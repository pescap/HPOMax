# HPOMax 

Easy-to-configure hyper-parameters (HPs) optimization for Deep Learning simulations on top of [Scikit-Optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/index.html). 

This library allows to parse easily the parameters for your model. Then, you can configure the HPs that will be optimized, and run the `skopt.gp_minimize` function. The `template` folder allows to define new HPO processes.

This library was used for HPO applied to physics-informed neural networks in:
